## Architecture (FE/BE)

The project's architecture is documented, under `architecture.drawio`. The file can be opened,
via [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), or via
the [draw.io intellij plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15635-diagrams-net-integration)

⚠️ **Any architectural changes need to be reflected in this file and committed!** ⚠️
